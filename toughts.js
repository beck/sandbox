I need...
  a local server hosting the code under test
  a test framework (and assertion lib) to write my tests
  if target browser is installed locally
    a selenium server
    a webdriver for target browser
  otherwise
    an account somewhere in the cloud
    a proxy server so cloud browser can see local server
  a test runner to execute tests in browser (or broker cloud & proxy)
  ... and pray fuck I don't need to transpile anything.
